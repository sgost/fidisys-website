## Overview & Features

User when scans the QR code will open the website of the menu of that particular hotel which then allow the users to order their food and pay for their order upfront without any physical contact.

## Problem & Solution

Customers in the restaurant are used to see a physical menu, the main problem relies making the user to take out their mobile and scan the QR code and visit our website to order. So we went on with attractive poster with the QR code in it and when the site opens, we provided an experience similar to online food deliver app with multiple categories and description about the food.

## Challenges

The users should not be prompted to be authenticated till they place their order and the integration of the payment gateway interface was challenging.

## Benefits

Acted a game changer during the COVID time whether the people are skeptical about the physical menu.

The restaurant runner got the insights of the preferences of the customers.
