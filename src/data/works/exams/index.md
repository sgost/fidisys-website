## Overview & Features

# FEATURES

Score is a mobile app to take up online tests. Application has two product flavors which ships Students and Teacher versions of the app. We used Flutter framework for this app having an idea of extending the Web version of the app and to have native features. Leaderboard for displaying the tests scores is built as a separate app using the react framework.

App for the teachers has features like scheduling tests for a particular subject, adding descriptive type questions and answer keys, editing and deleting the questions. After evaluation of tests, the app automatically creates mark sheets for the students who have enrolled in those tests. App for the students allow them to take up the tests within the stipulated time and submit the tests. We also built a web version of the leader board to display the scores of the students in a particular subject.

## Problem & Solution

# SOLUTION

To move one step ahead from the point where the current education system lies and to adopt existing technologies for conducting tests for the students and evaluating it and to streamline the way of teaching and other activities even during unexpected situations like lockdown or during the monsoon period etc., where most of the schools were shut down for a week or so.

The idea was to build mobile applications for the students to take up the tests and teachers to conduct tests. So we built two apps where one serves as the platform for the teachers to schedule tests, prepare questions and answer keys. On the other side students can also take up the tests via app and submit their response. All the tests were evaluated by the system itself thus reducing the efforts of teachers.

## Development

# DEVELOPMENT

We follow the BLoc pattern to manage events and states, making the codebase robust and testable. All the data shown in the app are fetched from the remote. We have our backend code written in Node.js and deployed to AWS. Fastlane is integrated for deploying the apps to the play store.

## Challenges

# CHALLENGES

Till now with all the features we have developed, the challenge is to evaluate the descriptive answers.

## Benefits

# BENEFITS
