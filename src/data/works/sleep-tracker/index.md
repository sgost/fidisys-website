## Overview & Features

Gamified app which kicks every individual in the house to take up a challenge and get a reward upon successfully completing the challenge. Any individual can create a house and the person who creates the house will be the house leader. House leaders can add their fellow-mates to be a member of the house and can assign a challenge to the housemates.

Users can create houses for their housemates and assign tasks to them. Any individual who wants to join in particular house can search by the house name and join. In order to have fair game, tasks for every individual are suggested by a bot ‘Cona Boss’. Individuals who complete the task can share the pictures of it via the share option available in app. He/She will be rewarded with the points by the housemates based on accuracy of the activity and timeliness. Individuals are ranked in the leaderboard based on the reward points they hold.

## Problem & Solution

Year 2020 has created its own identity of making all individuals locked down in their houses for a couple of months. In order to prevent all individuals from boredom and spend everyday filled with lots of fun and activities, we came up with the idea of Housemates.

The idea was to make every individual busy by assigning them a task. Therefore we have created a platform for the users to create a virtual house and adding members to the house. The user who creates the house is an admin and supervises the completion of tasks by the housemates and rewarding them.

## Development

Application was built using React Framework and adapted into native android app using web view. Backend was built on RoR. The communication between the web view form the app and react app is performed using Javascript Interface mechanism.

## Challenges

Caching the resources in the app for fast reloading of the pages.

## Benefits

1. To have recreation amidst the daily life.
2. Save the activities done by the individuals as a picture as one of their memories.
3. Surprises individuals with tasks as it was assigned by a bot.
